Bariatric surgery is usually effective on its own for weight loss, but an increasing proportion of patients who undergo bariatric surgery start taking one of the new glucagon-like 1 peptide receptor agonist (GLP-1) weight-loss drugs in the years after their surgery, according to a new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The researchers analyzed de-identified national electronic health records covering 112,858 individuals who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2015 to May 2023. They found that 14% of those patients used a GLP-1 such as semaglutide (Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Zepbound) during a follow-up period of up to 10 years after surgery.
