New research has found that the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, a class of medications commonly prescribed for patients with obesity and diabetes, reduces the environmental footprint of healthcare and clinical outcomes when used to treat heart failure. Treatment of heart failure patients with these therapies led to fewer hospitalizations and lower calorie intake, which together translated into decreased greenhouse gas emissions, less medical waste, and reduced water usage. The study is one of the first to quantify the environmental co-benefits of pharmacologic treatment.
