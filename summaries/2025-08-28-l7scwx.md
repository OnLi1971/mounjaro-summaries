Top doctor has revealed how patients can tackle one of Mounjaro's most mortifying side effects – the 'sulphur burps' leaving users with breath that reeks of rotten eggs. The blockbuster weight-loss jab, also used to treat type 2 diabetes, is part of a new class of drugs transforming obesity treatment worldwide. Alongside rivals Wegovy and Ozempic, Mounjaro has been dished out to more than 1.5 million Britons – the vast majority through private clinics.
