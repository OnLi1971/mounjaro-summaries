NHS prescriptions for Mounjaro (tirzepatide; Eli Lilly) will be reimbursed at the new higher list prices, following an agreement between Community Pharmacy England (CPE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The agreement, announced on 27 August 2025, covers branded and generically written NHS prescriptions for all strengths of Mounjaro dispensed from 1 September 2025, which ensures that pharmacy owners will not be dispensing at a loss. This follows Lilly’s decision to increase UK list prices for the weight-loss medicine from 1 September 2025 to address “pricing inconsistencies” compared to other developed countries, including in Europe.
