News that weight-loss jab Mounjaro has become the latest casualty of global politics would have come as a disappointment to patients across the UK. Eli Lilly, its US-based manufacturer, recently confirmed that the price of the drug will rise steeply for British patients from September 1 as a result of a White House push to raise drug prices in Europe so they can be lowered in the US. As a doctor, I know this will be worrying for the estimated 1.5million people who buy the injection privately in the UK.
