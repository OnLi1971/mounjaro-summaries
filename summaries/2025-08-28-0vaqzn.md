The highly anticipated launch of the iOS 26 operating system by Apple next month, besides the iPhone 17 series, might serve as a major roadblock for US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party ahead of the midterms. Several Republicans believe that the next monthâ€™s iPhone update will disproportionately put the brakes on conservative fundraising as well as their voter outreach efforts. This might echo the past controversies surrounding Big Tech, which earlier targeted the voters of the GOP across the United States, as per Fox News.
