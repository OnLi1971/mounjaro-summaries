The higher doses of Mounjaro (tirzepatide) typically lead to greater weight loss, with clinical trials showing approximately 6-7% additional weight loss when increasing from 5 mg to 15 mg. Most people will lose more weight as they progress to higher doses, but the relationship isnâ€™t perfectly linear; the jump from 2.5 mg to 5 mg often produces more significant increases in weight loss than the jump from 12.5 mg to 15 mg. Clinical trials show that while the 15 mg maintenance dose of Mounjaro produces the most substantial average weight loss (~22.5% over 72 weeks), many people achieve impressive results on middle doses, especially when combined with healthy eating habits and physical activity.
