- The price of the weight loss jab Mounjaro will rise by up to 170% in the UK, its US manufacturer has said, as Donald Trump ramps up pressure on drugmakers to increase their prices for Europeans so that they can make them more affordable for Americans.Eli Lilly has said it will increase the price of the drug from September, with a month’s supply of the highest dose rising from £122 to £330.Mounjaro contains tirzepatide and is self-administered in weekly injections.When it was launched in Britain in February 2024, Eli Lilly agreed to a list price “significantly below” its other European markets to stop delays in availability of the medicine through the NHS.The increase in the list price will align it “more consistently”, the company said, although it added that the NHS would not pay the new, higher price to ensure continued access for people with obesity and type 2 diabetes receiving it through the health service.Eli Lilly said it was working with private healthcare providers, which could negotiate their own confidential discounts with the company.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
