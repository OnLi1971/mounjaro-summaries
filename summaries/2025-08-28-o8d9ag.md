Some patients taking the weight-loss drug Mounjaro have told BBC News they are struggling to obtain the medicine, and are worried about the impact on their health. There is rising demand for the drug, after the US manufacturer Eli Lilly announced a major price increase from 1 September. The drug giant has warned against "inappropriate stockpiling of medicines" and has now asked UK distributors to stop taking orders from pharmacies from the end of today.
