After Eli Lilly’s phase 3 data drop for its oral GLP-1 asset orforglipron earlier this month, the Indianapolis drugmaker has unveiled the second half of the data package that will support the med’s chances of securing a green light in obesity. Tuesday, Lilly reported that all three doses of orforglipron helped its late-stage Attain-2 trial meet its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints. The drug helped patients achieve up to an average of 23 pounds in weight loss as well as a reduction in average blood sugar levels and cardiometabolic risk factors by the trial’s 72-week mark.
