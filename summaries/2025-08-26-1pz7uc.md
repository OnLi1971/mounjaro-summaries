California-based Terns Pharmaceuticals was once a promising small player in the competitive obesity arena.

- By July that year, Roche had gone all-in on CT-388 (as well as CT-996, another Carmot asset), with CEO Thomas Schinecker telling investors that the pharma would put its obesity assets on the “fast-track.”But two years later, in July 2025, Roche hit a speed bump when it scrapped CT-173, also obtained from Carmot, after deciding it would not be able to compete in the current landscape. “When we bounced it up against our bar assessment, the criteria for developability and competitiveness just weren’t there,” Teresa Graham, CEO of Roche’s pharmaceuticals division, told investors at the time.CT-173 promotes weight loss by mimicking the PYY hormone, which in the gut helps to tamp down appetite and modulate gastric motility.
- Early data shared in May 2023 showed the asset lowered energy intake and slowed down gastric emptying, which Gubra at the time said supported further studies.A readout in October 2024 seconded the additive benefits of BI 1820237 on top of Victoza, but also recorded high rates of toxicities: 39% of treated patients experienced side effects, most of which were gastrointestinal in nature, including nausea and vomiting.That same month, Boehringer opted to terminate development of BI 1820237, according to an announcement from Gubra, which did not reveal the specific reason for the discontinuation.
- Now, it’s leaving the space altogether.The biotech made waves in September 2024 when a Phase I readout for its GLP-1 pill TERN-601 found the drug could shave 5% off of participants’ body weight after 28 days, an effect that BMO Capital Markets at the time called “compelling.” Analysts put it in the same league as Eli Lilly’s orforglipron, which has since become one of the most closely watched oral obesity candidates.Fast-forward almost a year, however, and Terns has abandoned further investment into not just TERN-601 but its entire metabolic pipeline.
- A month later, the biotech announced that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase II STRIDES study for azelaprag in obesity.Bolstering the company’s belief in azelaprag were Phase I data, released in late 2022, which showed the molecule could help preserve muscle in patients on bed rest, indicating its potential to elicit better-quality weight loss.BioAge had also just received a hefty $170 million infusion from its series D financing in February 2024—further validation of the market’s confidence in its pipeline, anchored by azelaprag.
- Amgen itself has pushed MariTide hard, with Chief Scientific Officer James Bradner telling investors in May 2024 that the pharma will “move rapidly” to advance the asset past mid-stage development and into a “broad Phase III program.”During that same investor call, Amgen also revealed that it was scrapping its little-known, early-stage weight-loss molecule AMG 786. “In obesity, we’re differentially investing in MariTide and a number of preclinical assets,” Bradner said.
- Over the years, several companies, both big and small, have tried and failed to see their obesity drugs through clinical trials, tripped up by a number of issues, not least of which are safety concerns and the lack of something to set them apart in a cut-throat market.Here, BioSpace reviews the weight-loss wasteland, focusing on five molecules that were once hailed as promising entries into the obesity arena but ultimately failed to deliver.
- William Sessa, who at the time was chief scientific officer of Pfizer’s internal medicine division, said that if danuglipron did well in clinical studies, it “could be in a prime position to differentiate based on profile, including full receptor agonism, which we believe has the potential to translate to robust efficacy.” Sessa left Pfizer last month, according to his LinkedIn page.But almost immediately, danuglipron hit rough waters.
- For € 250 million—worth approximately $292 million in today’s money—in upfront and success-based milestones, Hørsholm-based Gubra gave Boehringer access to a handful of novel peptide therapies for obesity, including a neuropeptide Y receptor agonist that would eventually be dubbed BI 1820237.The partners ran a Phase I study of BI 1820237 in men with overweight, testing the injection alone or in combination with Novo Nordisk’s Victoza.
