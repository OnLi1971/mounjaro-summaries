Eli Lilly on Tuesday said its daily weight loss pill helped patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes shed weight in a late-stage trial, meeting the study's main goal and clearing the way for the company to file for approval of the drug globally.

More convenient pills could boost supply for the treatments and make them easier to access than the pricey weekly injections currently dominating the space.
