Significantly greater total body weight loss was achieved by the menopausal hormone therapy vs the non-menopausal hormone therapy group (17 vs 14%).

- In addition, the proportion of women who achieved greater than or equal to 20% total body weight loss by the last follow-up was higher in the +MHT versus the −MHT group (45 vs 18%). “These data are the first to show the combined use of tirzepatide and menopause hormone therapy significantly increases treatment effectiveness in postmenopausal women,” coauthor Regina Castaneda, MD, also from the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement.
- HealthDay News — In postmenopausal women with overweight or obesity receiving tirzepatide, use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is associated with superior weight loss outcomes, according to a study presented at ENDO 2025, the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, held from July 12 to 15 in San Francisco.
- Dima Bechenati, MD, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and colleagues examined whether tirzepatide efficacy differs between postmenopausal women using MHT (+MHT) vs those not using MHT (−MHT) in the treatment of overweight and obesity.
- Propensity score matching was used in a real-world study, with each +MHT participant matched to 2 −MHT controls based on age, body mass index, age at menopause, menopause type, and diabetes status.
- The researchers found that at the last follow-up, significantly greater total body weight loss was achieved by the +MHT vs the −MHT group (17 vs 14%).
- Significantly greater total body weight loss was achieved by the menopausal hormone therapy vs the non-menopausal hormone therapy group (17 vs 14%).
- A total of 120 women were included in the analysis after propensity score matching: 40 in the +MHT group and 80 in the −MHT group.
- The median follow-up duration was 18 months for both groups.
