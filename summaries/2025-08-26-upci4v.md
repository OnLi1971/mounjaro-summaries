This systematic review evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity, focusing on data from high-quality randomized controlled trials published be

- This review synthesizes findings from studies assessing agents such as semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, and exenatide in diverse populations, including adults with and without type 2 diabetes and adolescents with severe obesity.
- This systematic review evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity, focusing on data from high-quality randomized controlled trials published between 2018 and 2025.
- Despite the promising outcomes, limitations in follow-up durations, population diversity, and real-world generalizability highlight areas for future research.
- Additionally, the agents showed generally acceptable safety profiles, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most frequently reported adverse events.
- The results reinforce the need to conceptualize obesity as a chronic condition requiring long-term pharmacological management.
- Most studies demonstrated sustained weight loss and favorable glycemic control over treatment durations of 40-120 weeks.
