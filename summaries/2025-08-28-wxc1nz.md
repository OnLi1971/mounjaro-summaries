Major UK pharmacy chains are experiencing nationwide shortages of the weight-loss drug Mounjaro after manufacturer Eli Lilly announced a 170 per cent price increase effective September. The highest dose will rise from £122 to £330 per month, triggering panic buying across the country. Superdrug, Boots, and Lloyds Pharmacy are all reporting stock shortages as patients rush to stockpile supplies before the price hike takes effect.
