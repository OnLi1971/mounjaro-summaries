Eli Lilly LLY.N said on Tuesday its experimental GLP-1 pill helped overweight adults with type 2 diabetes shed 10.5% of body weight in a late-stage trial, after recent data from another study of the drug in patients without diabetes sent company shares tumbling. Shares of the drugmaker rose 2.4% to $712 in premarket trading. The once-daily pill also helped 75% of patients who received the highest dose of orforglipron lower their A1C level - a measure of blood sugar over time - to at or below 6.5%, Lilly said, which is below the American Diabetes Association's target of less than 7% for most adults.
