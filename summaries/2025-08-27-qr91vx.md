Our Phase 3 ATTAIN-2 study demonstrated that an oral GLP-1 has the potential to achieve weight loss consistent with injectables in patients with both diabetes and obesity — a population where weight loss has historically been most challenging. The results showed meaningful weight reduction and A1C improvements, with the majority of patients reaching below-diabetes thresholds. All from a once-daily pill with no food or water restrictions.
