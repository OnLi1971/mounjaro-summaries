Eli Lilly, in the race to develop the first major oral GLP‑1 drug for weight loss, says its pill orforglipron will be submitted for approval this year after a Phase 3 study found it delivered double-digit weight loss in people with Type 2 diabetes. The announcement comes as Eli Lilly concludes a Phase 3 study that found orforglipron delivered "significant weight loss, meaningful A1C reductions, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors" after 72 weeks. Eli Lilly says trial participants who took the highest dose of orforglipron lost an average of 10.5% of their body weight after 72 weeks.
